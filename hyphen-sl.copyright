For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to use
only the Lesser General Public License version 2.1 (LGPLv2) at this
time for any software where a choice of LGPL license versions is made
available with the language indicating that LGPLv2.1 or any later
version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the LGPL is
applied is otherwise unspecified.

On Debian systems, the full text of the LGPL can be found in
/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL.
